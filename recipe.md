## Ingredients:
### Adzuki Bean Cream:
- 160 grams Adzuki red bean (pre-soaked)
- 115 grams granulated sugar
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon powdered gelatin
- 5 teaspoon water
- 1 cup whipping cream 33% M.F.
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
### Matcha Cake:
- 60 ml whole fat milk
- 5 teaspoon matcha powder
- 4 egg whites
- ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
- 50 grams granulated sugar
- 45 grams cake flour
- 30 grams granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt
- 3 egg yolks
- 40 ml vegetable oil
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions:
### Matcha Cake:
1. Line a 8 X 12" rectangular cake pan with parchment paper.
2. Preheat oven to 325 F.
3. In a small sauce pan, pour in milk, sift in matcha powder.
4. Place over medium heat, keep stirring mixture until it starts to steam and no visible clumps of powder can be seen. Take off heat and set aside to cool. Do not let boil.
5. In a clean and dry, non-plastic mixing bowl, whip egg whites on slow speed until frothy, add cream of tartar. 
6. Increase speed to medium, once the whites become opaque and bubble size have tightened up, add sugar a little bit at a time.
7. Increase speed to med-high, whip until stiff peaks. (Note 2) You've now made a meringue.
8. In a large mixing bowl, sift in cake flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir to combine.
9. Create a well in the center. Inside it, add yolks, oil, vanilla extract and the now cooled matcha milk mixture.
10. Stir to combine until fully incorporated, do not over mix. 
11. Gently fold ⅓ of the meringue into the milk-flour mixture to get it moving. Once incorporated, fold in the rest of the meringue. Do not stir. Use batter immediately.
12. Pour batter into lined cake pan from one spot, spread out the batter evenly with an angled spatula.
13. Tap the pan on the counter to release large air pockets.
14. Bake for 10-12 min. at 325 F until a skewer pulls out clean and cake springs back in the center.
15. Let cool 5 min. in the pan before removing.
16. Place cooling rack over cake pan.
17. Flip cake over onto the rack, gently remove paper.
18. The side facing up will eventually become the top of the cake roll. Let it sit on cooling rack for 5 min.
19. Place a new piece of parchment paper on top of the cake.
20. Flip the cake over and start rolling, allowing the parchment paper to be in between the folds. This will prevent the cake from sticking to itself. It's important to roll the cake before it cools completely, otherwise, it will crack while rolling.
21. Let it cool in this wrapped condition while making the fresh cream.
### Adzuki Bean Cream:
1. Soak Adzuki beans in 3X the amount of water for a minimum of 1 hour or overnight.
2. Refrigerate mixing bowl and beaters in the fridge for a minimum of 15 minutes. This will help cream whip better.
3. Rinse pre-soaked beans to rid of any impurities and throw away damaged beans
4. Place in medium sized pot. Add enough water to go past the beans by 2 inches.
5. Using a medium high heat, bring water to a boil, then reduce to low for a light simmer.
6. Let beans simmer until it becomes soft, about 30 minutes (time will depend on how long it was pre-soaked).
7. Pour beans into a colander to drain water.
8. Add beans back into pot, add sugar and salt and stir on low heat until the water has evaporated and a line can be drawn in the beans with a spatula without disappearing.
9. Set aside to let cool.
10. Place water in a heatproof cup and sprinkle gelatin on top to bloom. Wait 5 minutes.
11. Place cup in a small sauce pan filled with simmering water. Once gelatin becomes liquid, take it out of the water. Let cool on the counter.
12. Immediately start beating the cream and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the chilled bowl. Whip on low speed and then increase to medium.
13. Check on the gelatin. It should no longer be warm but still runny.
14. Once the beaters leave tracks in the cream, pour the gelatin into the bowl slowly and steadily. Aim for the area in between the whisk and the bowl.
15. Stop beating once the cream turns stiff. Do not over whip.
16. Check that the beans have completely cooled off.
17. Mash half of the azuki beans into a paste with a potato masher or pulverize it in the food processor to make a paste.
18. Gently fold in the cooled Adzuki bean paste and whole beans into the whipped cream.
19. Use cream to assemble the cooled cake immediately.

### Assembly:
1. Gently unwrap rolled cake and spread an even layer of cream on it. (Note 3)
2. Carefully roll up the cake from the short edge using the parchment paper to help push the cake onto itself.
3. Wrap with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator to set before cutting.
4. Before serving, cut off sides for a cleaner presentation. Matcha cake roll can be kept in the fridge in an air tight container for 2-3 days. 

## Additional Notes
1. Some ingredients are repeated, use them in the same order as outlined in instructions.
2. Stiff peaks are characterized by egg whites that have a pointed peak when the whisk is pulled out. It points upwards and doesn't droop on itself.
3. Depending on the volume your cream attains once whipped, not all of the cream may be needed. A layer about ½" is recommended, with a bit more on the edge that will be rolled first.
